# Advent of Code 2023

## Notes

##### Day 01

Went for regex which made life pretty simple, part two errored as there is an issue with shared letters which the sample data did not catch. Tweaked the replacement to leave start/end letters to solve it but wasted lots of time. I blame the examples, they all passed fine =/

##### Day 02

Used a good data structure so was both tasks were quite straight forward. Wrote code for a wrongly anticipated part 2 but it was even simpler in the end.
